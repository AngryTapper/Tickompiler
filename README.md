# Tickompiler

Tickompiler is a compiler/decompiler for Tickflow, a language based on the bytecode format used by the game Rhythm Heaven Megamix to describe its rhythm games.

In-depth documentation for Tickflow can be found [here](http://tickompiler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Game files extracted and decompiled using this tool can be used in conjunction with [this patch](https://github.com/SneakySpook/RHMPatch).
